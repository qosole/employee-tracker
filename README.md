# Employee Tracker

## Description 

A command line application that allows the user to view and update a database. The database is composed of three tables: departments, roles, and employees. After the database is seeded, the user can run the application to view and update the database. In addition to department, roles, and employees, the database also holds data for employee salary and manager, as well as which role belongs to which department.

This project helped me build MySQL skills and my ability to visualize table-based databases. Trying to get the data using SQL for "3. View all employees" was definitely the highlight of this project.
